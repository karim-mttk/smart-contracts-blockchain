# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Linux command to run the program:

```shell
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --sepolia
```
