# smart-contracts-blockchain
This repository contains efficient and practical smart contract code used for operating decentralized applications on 
the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Through the use of Remix IDE, Ethers.js Simple Storage, Hardhat Simple Storage, 
Javascript Fund Me (Front End), Hardhat Smart Contract Lottery, NextJS Smart Contract Lottery (Front End), Hardhat NFTs, 
NextJS NFT Marketplace, the projects showcase the understanding and implementation of these tools. The code is perfect 
for those wanting to learn Solidity programming language and develop smart contracts on the blockchain. Inspiration and 
learning were derived from Patrick Collins' GitHub repository,
which can be found here: https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js.
