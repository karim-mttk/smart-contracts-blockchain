# Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain
This repository contains efficient and practical smart contract code used for operating decentralized applications on 
the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Through the use of Remix IDE, Ethers.js Simple Storage, Hardhat Simple Storage, 
Javascript Fund Me (Front End), Hardhat Smart Contract Lottery, NextJS Smart Contract Lottery (Front End), Hardhat NFTs, 
NextJS NFT Marketplace, the projects showcase the understanding and implementation of these tools. The code is perfect 
for those wanting to learn Solidity programming language and develop smart contracts on the blockchain. Inspiration and 
learning were derived from Patrick Collins' [GitHub repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js).

## Table of Contents

- [Project 1 ](https://github.com/karim-mttk/smart-contracts-blockchain/tree/main) **Solidity Language**: Creating and deploying smart contracts with Solidity and Remix IDE.
- [Project 2 ](https://github.com/karim-mttk/smart-contracts-blockchain/tree/ganache-local) **Ganache & Sepolia Testnet**: The same code from Project 1 has been rewritten in JavaScript. Contracts are now deployed to a private blockchain using Ganache and a public Ethereum test blockchain via the Sepolia testnet.
- [Project 3 ](https://github.com/karim-mttk/smart-contracts-blockchain/tree/hardhat) **Hardhat**: Compiling and deploying smart contracts by using Hardhat.
- [Project 4]()**Hardhat Fund Me**:
